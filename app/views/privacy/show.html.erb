<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 22, 2026</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Prowl ("we," "our," or "us") is a Shopify application that monitors product detail pages (PDPs)
  for broken functionality that may cause revenue loss. This Privacy Policy explains what data we
  collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.
</p>

<p>
  By installing and using Prowl, you agree to the data practices described in this policy.
</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>

<h3>Shop and Merchant Information</h3>
<p>When you install Prowl, we collect the following through Shopify OAuth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shop domain name</li>
  <li>Merchant account information (store owner name, email address)</li>
  <li>Store metadata (country, currency, timezone, Shopify plan)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Product Page Data</h3>
<p>When Prowl scans your monitored product pages, we collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product page URLs you select for monitoring</li>
  <li>Page HTML content (rendered by the storefront theme)</li>
  <li>Screenshots of the product page as it appears to customers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Error and Diagnostic Data</h3>
<p>During each scan, we capture:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript errors and console log output from the page</li>
  <li>Network request failures (e.g., broken image URLs, failed resource loads)</li>
  <li>Page load performance metrics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scan Results and Issue History</h3>
<p>We store:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scan results including status, timestamps, and detected issues</li>
  <li>Issue records with severity, type, occurrence count, and resolution status</li>
  <li>Alert history (when and where notifications were sent)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Merchant Email for Alerts</h3>
<p>
  We store the email address used for alert notifications. This is either your Shopify store email
  or a custom alert email you configure in Settings.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>

<p>We use collected data exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monitoring and diagnostics</strong> — scanning your product pages, detecting issues,
    and generating reports on your dashboard</li>
  <li><strong>Alerting</strong> — sending email notifications when critical issues are detected on
    your product pages</li>
  <li><strong>Service improvement</strong> — improving detection accuracy and reducing false
    positives</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your data with third parties. Your data is used
  solely to provide the Prowl service to you.
</p>

<h2>How We Collect Data</h2>

<p>
  Prowl scans your product pages using a headless browser — the same way a customer would visit
  your store. Scans run as a public visitor without admin privileges, session cookies, or access
  to private store data. We do not inject scripts, modify your theme, or access customer
  information.
</p>

<p>
  We only request read-only Shopify API permissions (<code>read_products</code> and
  <code>read_themes</code>). We cannot modify your products, themes, orders, or any other
  store data.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scan results and screenshots</strong> are retained for the duration of your active
    subscription to provide historical comparison and trend analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Issue records</strong> are retained while your subscription is active and the
    monitored page exists.</li>
  <li><strong>Console logs and error data</strong> are retained as part of scan records for
    diagnostic purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Shop and merchant information</strong> is retained while the app is installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Upon app uninstall, all data associated with your store is purged from our systems within
  48 hours. This includes scan results, screenshots, issue records, diagnostic logs, and
  account information.
</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All data is transmitted over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
  <li>Data at rest is stored in encrypted databases</li>
  <li>Screenshots are stored in private object storage accessible only via signed URLs</li>
  <li>Application credentials are encrypted using Rails encrypted credentials</li>
  <li>Store-level data isolation ensures merchants can only access their own data</li>
</ul>

<h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>

<p>
  If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or other regions with
  data protection laws, you have the following rights:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Right of access</strong> — You may request a copy of the data we hold about your
    store.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to rectification</strong> — You may request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to erasure</strong> — You may request deletion of your data at any time.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong> — You may request your data in a
    machine-readable format.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to restrict processing</strong> — You may request that we limit how we use
    your data.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to object</strong> — You may object to our processing of your data.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

  <li>Payment or checkout information</li>
  <li>Admin credentials or store secrets</li>
  <li>Private or draft content</li>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
  Prowl may use third-party infrastructure providers (hosting, databases, object storage) to
  operate the service. These providers are bound by their own privacy and security policies and
  process data only as necessary to provide infrastructure services to us.
</p>

<p>
  We do not share your data with third-party analytics, advertising, or marketing services.
</p>

<h2>Shopify Billing</h2>

<p>
  Subscription billing is handled entirely through Shopify's built-in Billing API. We never see,
  process, or store your payment information.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will
  notify you through the app or via email. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page
  indicates when the policy was last revised.
