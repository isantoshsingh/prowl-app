<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

<p>
  This Privacy Policy describes how <strong><%= ShopifyApp.configuration.application_name %></strong> ("Prowl", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you install and use our Shopify application. By installing Prowl, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
</p>

<h2>What Prowl Does</h2>
<p>
  Prowl is a product page monitoring tool for Shopify merchants. It automatically scans your product pages (PDPs) to detect issues such as broken Add to Cart buttons, JavaScript errors, missing images, pricing display problems, and slow page loads — issues that can silently hurt your sales.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Information collected through Shopify's APIs</h3>
<p>
  When you install Prowl, we request the following <strong>read-only</strong> Shopify API access scopes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>read_products</strong> — to retrieve your product catalog so you can select which product pages to monitor.</li>
  <li><strong>read_themes</strong> — to read your theme configuration and accurately detect page elements during scans.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Through these scopes, we access:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product titles, handles, and image URLs for the products you choose to monitor.</li>
  <li>Theme configuration data to understand your store's page structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We do <strong>not</strong> access or modify your product data, orders, customer information, or any other store data beyond what is listed above.
</p>
