# Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to the most common questions about Silent Profit.

---

## Does Silent Profit slow down my store?

**No.** Silent Profit scans your pages in the background using its own browser — it does not add any code, scripts, or tracking to your storefront. Your customers' experience is completely unaffected.

The scanning process is the same as if someone visited your product page in a regular browser. It does not modify your theme, inject scripts, or affect page load speed for your customers.

---

## How often does it scan my pages?

Silent Profit scans your monitored pages **once per day**, automatically. Scans run at 6:00 AM UTC so your results are ready when you start your day.

You can also **trigger a manual rescan** anytime by clicking the "Rescan" button next to any product page on your dashboard. This is useful after you've made changes and want to verify a fix right away.

---

## How many pages can I monitor?

You can monitor **up to 5 product pages** at a time. We recommend choosing your best-selling or highest-traffic products to get the most value.

You can change which pages you're monitoring at any time from your dashboard — just remove a page and add a different one.

---

## What themes are supported?

Silent Profit works with **all Shopify themes** — both free themes from Shopify (like Dawn) and third-party themes from the Theme Store or custom developers.

Because Silent Profit scans your pages the same way a customer would visit them, it doesn't depend on any specific theme structure. If a customer can see your product page, Silent Profit can scan it.

## What if something is flagged incorrectly?

While Silent Profit is designed to minimize false positives, no scanning tool is perfect. If you see an issue that doesn't seem right, here's what you can do:

1. **Visit the page yourself** — Check whether the problem is visible when you browse the page as a customer. Try both desktop and mobile.

2. **Acknowledge the issue** — If you've reviewed it and everything looks fine, click "Acknowledge" on the issue. This tells Silent Profit you've seen it and prevents further alerts for that specific issue.

3. **Wait for the next scan** — Sometimes a one-time loading glitch can cause a false detection. Silent Profit requires high-priority issues to appear on **two consecutive scans** before sending you an alert, which helps filter out temporary problems.

4. **Rescan the page** — Hit the "Rescan" button to run a fresh check. If the issue doesn't reappear, it was likely a temporary glitch and will resolve automatically.

If you notice a pattern of incorrect detections, please let us know so we can improve our scanning.

## Is my store data safe?

**Yes.** Silent Profit takes data security seriously:

- **Read-only access** — Silent Profit only requests permission to *read* your product and theme data. It cannot modify your products, themes, orders, or any other store data.

- **No customer data** — Silent Profit does not access or store any of your customer information. It only looks at your product pages from a public visitor's perspective.

- **Scans are like a customer visit** — The scanning process visits your public product page URLs the same way any customer would. No private or admin data is accessed during a scan.

- **Secure infrastructure** — Your data is transmitted and stored securely. We follow industry-standard security practices.

- **Shopify-approved billing** — All billing is handled through Shopify's built-in billing system. We never see or store your payment information.

## How much does Silent Profit cost?

Silent Profit is **$10 per month** with a **14-day free trial**. You can try it completely free for two weeks to see the value before you're charged.

Billing is handled entirely through Shopify, so there's nothing extra to set up.

---

## Can I change my alert email?

Yes. Go to **Settings** in the Silent Profit dashboard to set a custom email address for alerts. If you don't set one, alerts will be sent to the email associated with your Shopify store.

---

## What happens if I uninstall the app?

If you uninstall Silent Profit, all monitoring stops immediately and your subscription is cancelled. Your scan history and settings are removed.

If you reinstall later, you'll start fresh with a new setup.
