# Getting Started with Silent Profit

Welcome to Silent Profit! This guide walks you through what happens after you install the app, and what to expect as it starts monitoring your product pages.

## What Does Silent Profit Do?

Silent Profit watches your product pages for hidden problems that could be costing you sales. Things like a broken "Add to Cart" button, missing product images, or price display issues can stop customers from buying — and you might never notice.

Silent Profit automatically scans your product pages, detects these problems, and alerts you so you can fix them before they hurt your revenue.

## What Happens After You Install

1. **Billing approval** — Shopify will ask you to approve the subscription ($10/month with a 14-day free trial). You won't be charged during the trial.

2. **Add product pages to monitor** — From the Silent Profit dashboard in your Shopify admin, select up to 5 product pages you want to monitor. We recommend starting with your best-selling products.

3. **First scan runs automatically** — Once you add pages, Silent Profit will scan them. You can also trigger a scan manually at any time by clicking the "Rescan" button next to any page.

4. **Review your results** — After a scan completes, you'll see the status of each page on your dashboard. Green means everything looks good. Yellow or red means there may be issues to look into.

## What to Expect from Your First Scan

- Each page scan takes up to **30 seconds**. Silent Profit visits your page just like a customer would, using a browser behind the scenes.
- Results appear on your dashboard as soon as each scan finishes.
- If an issue is found on the first scan, it will show up in your dashboard right away — but you won't get an email alert until the same issue is confirmed on a second scan. This helps avoid false alarms.

## Daily Monitoring

After the initial scan, Silent Profit automatically scans your monitored pages **once per day** (at 6:00 AM UTC). You don't need to do anything — it runs in the background.

If a high-priority issue persists across two consecutive scans, you'll receive an email alert so you can take action.

## Your Dashboard at a Glance

From your Silent Profit dashboard, you can:

- **See the health status** of each monitored product page
- **View detected issues** with details about what's wrong and why it matters
- **Trigger a manual rescan** if you've made changes and want to verify a fix
- **Manage your settings** — change your alert email, adjust scan preferences, and more
